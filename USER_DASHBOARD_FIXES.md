# User Dashboard Statistics Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Import Statement Error** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: User dashboard APIs were using incorrect Prisma import
- `import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'` (incorrect)
**Solution**: 
- `import prisma from '@/lib/prisma'` (correct default import)

### 2. **Session Handling Error** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Using incorrect session parameter format for App Router
- `await getServerSession(authOptions, req, {} as any)` (incorrect)
**Solution**:
- `await getServerSession(authOptions)` (correct for App Router)

### 3. **Active Listings Logic Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Dashboard showed "Active Listings" but didn't match user expectations
- Previous: Only checked `isActive` property
- User expectation: Active listings = approved AND active properties
**Solution**:
```typescript
// Old logic
const activeListings = properties.filter(p => p.isActive).length;

// New logic  
const activeListings = properties.filter(p => 
  p.isActive && p.moderationStatus === 'APPROVED'
).length;
```

### 4. **Missing Debug Information** ✅ ADDED
**Problem**: No visibility into what data was being calculated
**Solution**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track:
- User ID
- Total properties count
- Individual property statuses
- Calculated statistics

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/api/dashboard/overview/route.ts`**:
   - Fixed Prisma import
   - Fixed session handling
   - Improved active listings calculation
   - Added debug logging

2. **`src/app/api/dashboard/recent-properties/route.ts`**:
   - Fixed Prisma import  
   - Fixed session handling

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the user dashboard should show:

✅ **My Properties**: Total count of all user's properties (matches properties page)
✅ **Active Listings**: Only properties that are both active AND approved
✅ **Total Views**: Sum of view counts across all properties
✅ **Inquiries**: Count of inquiries for user's properties

The statistics should now be consistent between:
- Dashboard Overview page
- My Properties page  
- User's actual approved listings on search pages

## Testing Steps

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Navigate to user dashboard** (`/dashboard/overview`)
3. **Check statistics display**:
   - My Properties should show 3 (matching your properties page)
   - Active Listings should show 3 (if all are approved and active)
   - Compare with `/dashboard/properties` page
4. **Verify consistency** across all user dashboard pages

## Debug Information

The APIs now log detailed information to help diagnose any remaining issues. Check the Vercel function logs if needed to see:
- What properties are found for the user
- Property status breakdown
- Calculated statistics

The user dashboard statistics should now accurately reflect the actual data shown on individual pages.

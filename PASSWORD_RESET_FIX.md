# Password Reset Issue Fix

## Problem
The password reset functionality is returning a 500 Internal Server Error when users try to reset their password.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is likely caused by one or more of the following:

1. **Missing Email Configuration**: The email service (SendGrid or nodemailer) is not properly configured
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Prisma client might not be connecting to the database
3. **Missing Environment Variables**: Required environment variables are not set

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Test Database Connection
Visit: `https://properties.larnaceiglobal.com/api/test-db`

This will check if the database connection is working.

### 2. Test Email Configuration
Visit: `https://properties.larnaceiglobal.com/api/test-email`

This will check if email services are properly configured.

### 3. Check Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

#### For SendGrid (Primary Email Service):
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=info@larnaceiglobal.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Larnacei Property Platform
```

#### For Nodemailer (Fallback Email Service):
```
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
```

#### Required for All:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://properties.larnaceiglobal.com
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
DIRECT_URL=your_direct_database_url
```

## Immediate Fix

### For Development Environment
The code has been updated to include a development fallback. In development mode, instead of sending emails, it will log the password reset link to the console.

### For Production Environment

1. **Configure SendGrid** (Recommended):
   - Sign up for a SendGrid account
   - Create an API key
   - Add the API key to your environment variables
   - Verify your sender email address

2. **Configure Nodemailer** (Alternative):
   - Set up SMTP credentials (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - Add SMTP configuration to environment variables

3. **Verify Database Connection**:
   - Ensure your database is running
   - Check that DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL are correct
   - Run `npx prisma db push` to ensure schema is up to date

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed console logging to track the password reset process
- Better error handling with specific error messages
- Development mode fallback for testing

### 2. Improved Email Service
- Better error handling in email service
- Development mode that logs reset links instead of sending emails
- More detailed logging for debugging

### 3. Test Endpoints
- `/api/test-db` - Test database connection
- `/api/test-email` - Test email configuration

## Testing the Fix

1. **In Development**:
   - The password reset will work without email configuration
   - Check the console for the reset link
   - The link will be logged instead of sent via email

2. **In Production**:
   - Configure email services as described above
   - Test the password reset functionality
   - Check server logs for any remaining issues

## Next Steps

1. Configure email services for production
2. Test the password reset functionality
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Consider implementing email delivery tracking

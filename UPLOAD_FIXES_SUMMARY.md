# Upload Functionality Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Request Entity Too Large (413 Error)** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Files were too large for Vercel's default limits
**Solution**: 
- Reduced image upload limit from 10MB to 4.5MB
- Reduced video upload limit from 100MB to 30MB
- Updated mobile upload utility validation to match new limits

### 2. **JSON Parsing Errors** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Server responses were not properly formatted as JSON
**Solution**:
- Added explicit `Content-Type: application/json` headers to all responses
- Ensured consistent JSON response format across all upload endpoints

### 3. **Vercel Function Timeout** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Upload functions were timing out on large files
**Solution**:
- Extended timeout for image uploads to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Extended timeout for video uploads to 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Updated `vercel.json` configuration with specific timeouts for upload endpoints

### 4. **File Size Validation** ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: Client-side validation didn't match server-side limits
**Solution**:
- Synchronized validation limits across:
  - Mobile upload utility (client-side)
  - Upload API endpoints (server-side)
  - User feedback messages

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`vercel.json`**: Added specific timeout configurations for upload endpoints
2. **`src/app/api/upload-images/route.ts`**: 
   - Reduced file size limit to 4.5MB
   - Added proper JSON headers
   - Improved error handling
3. **`src/app/api/upload-videos/route.ts`**:
   - Reduced file size limit to 30MB
   - Added proper JSON headers
   - Improved error handling
4. **`src/utils/mobile-upload.ts`**: 
   - Updated file size validation to match server limits
   - Updated user-facing error messages

### New File Size Limits:
- **Images**: 4.5MB (down from 10MB)
- **Videos**: 30MB (down from 100MB)

### New Timeout Configurations:
- **Image Upload**: 5 minutes
- **Video Upload**: 10 minutes
- **Other APIs**: 30 seconds (default)

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the upload functionality should:

✅ **No more 413 errors** - Files within limits will upload successfully
✅ **No more JSON parsing errors** - Proper response headers ensure valid JSON
✅ **No more timeout errors** - Extended timeouts handle large file processing
✅ **Better user feedback** - Clear error messages for oversized files
✅ **Consistent validation** - Client and server limits are synchronized

## Testing Instructions

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Try uploading images** under 4.5MB each
3. **Try uploading videos** under 30MB each
4. **Check for proper error messages** when files exceed limits
5. **Verify property creation** works with uploaded media

## Notes

- These limits are optimized for Vercel's serverless function constraints
- Cloudinary will still optimize and compress uploaded files
- Users will get clear feedback if files are too large
- Multiple smaller files can be uploaded instead of single large files

The upload functionality should now work reliably within Vercel's platform limitations.

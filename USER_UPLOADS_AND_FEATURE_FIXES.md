# User Upload Size Limits & Admin Feature Property Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **User Image Upload Size Mismatch** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Users were getting upload failures due to mismatched size limits
- **Frontend validation**: Allowed 5MB images
- **Backend API**: Limited to 4.5MB (Vercel optimization)
- **Result**: Users could select 5MB files but uploads would fail

**Solution**: Synchronized all size limits to match backend constraints
- Updated frontend validation to 4.5MB for images, 30MB for videos
- Updated user-facing messages to reflect correct limits
- Updated both drag-and-drop and file selection handlers

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/forms/property-listing/Step4Media.tsx`

**New Size Limits**:
- **Images**: 4.5MB (down from 5MB)
- **Videos**: 30MB (down from 50MB)
- **Display Text**: Updated to show correct limits

### 2. **Admin Feature Property Toggle** ✅ ADDED

**Problem**: No way for admins to feature/unfeature properties from admin dashboard

**Solution**: Added complete feature toggle functionality

#### **New API Endpoint**: `/api/admin/properties/[id]/feature`
- **Method**: POST
- **Function**: Toggles `isFeatured` status of property
- **Security**: Admin authentication required
- **Response**: Returns updated property status

#### **Admin UI Enhancements**:
- **Featured Badge**: Yellow badge with sparkle icon shows when property is featured
- **Feature Toggle Button**: Sparkle icon button to toggle featured status
- **Visual Feedback**: Button color changes based on featured status
- **Loading State**: Button disabled during API call

#### **Button Behavior**:
- **Unfeatured Property**: Gray sparkle icon → Click to feature
- **Featured Property**: Yellow sparkle icon → Click to unfeature  
- **Tooltip**: Shows "Add to Featured" or "Remove from Featured"
- **Real-time Update**: Property list refreshes immediately after toggle

## How It Works

### **User Upload Flow (Fixed)**:
1. User selects images up to 4.5MB each
2. Frontend validates file size before allowing selection
3. Upload succeeds without size mismatches
4. Clear error messages if files are oversized

### **Admin Feature Property Flow (New)**:
1. Admin views properties in admin dashboard
2. Clicks sparkle icon on any property
3. API toggles `isFeatured` status in database
4. Property immediately appears/disappears from featured sections
5. Featured properties show on home page "Featured Properties" section

## Expected Results

### **User Uploads**:
✅ **No more upload failures** due to size mismatches
✅ **Clear feedback** on file size limits  
✅ **Consistent validation** between frontend and backend
✅ **Better user experience** with accurate size information

### **Admin Feature Management**:
✅ **One-click property featuring** from admin dashboard
✅ **Immediate visual feedback** with featured badges
✅ **Real-time updates** to featured property lists
✅ **Featured properties appear** on home page automatically

## Testing Instructions

### **Test User Uploads**:
1. Go to `/list-property` as a regular user
2. Try uploading images between 4-5MB
3. Should see updated size limits in UI (4.5MB)
4. Uploads should succeed without size errors

### **Test Admin Feature Toggle**:
1. Go to `/admin/properties` as admin
2. Click sparkle icon on any approved property
3. Should see:
   - Button changes color (gray ↔ yellow)
   - Featured badge appears/disappears
   - Property status updates immediately
4. Check home page - featured property should appear in "Featured Properties"

## Integration Points

- **Featured Properties**: Automatically syncs with home page featured section
- **Database**: Updates `isFeatured` boolean field in Property table  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Shows feature status in property cards
- **Home Page**: Displays featured properties in dedicated section

Both fixes ensure better user experience and give admins full control over property featuring without technical barriers.
